## My process

For my process I used solely CSS and HTML purley to demonstrate my skills with flexbox and css grid. I used a moble first workflow then added the media qieries for tablet and desktop.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt a lot of about the placing of elements within the page. For example I had an issue with padding then realised that I was not applying it correctly on my elements which were causing issues further on. I also learnt about placing elements offset using the transform/translate rules.


### Continued development

I want to further develop my skills with css in terms of grid and flexbox as I feel they will really benefit me going forward in my career.

### Useful resources

- [Firefox devtools intoduction to grid](https://mozilladevelopers.github.io/playground/css-grid/03-firefox-devtools/) - This helped me to understand how to start a grid. I really liked this method of implementing a grid and will use it going forward.
